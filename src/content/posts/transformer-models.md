Transformers have changed the way we handle sequential data, but their impact extends far beyond language models. Read on to discover how they're revolutionizing computer vision and audio processing.

## Background on Transformers
Long before GPT-3, the transformer architecture was proposed in "Attention is All You Need." It replaced RNNs and LSTMs with a simpler, more parallelizable mechanism.

## Beyond Text: Computer Vision
Vision Transformers (ViT) apply the same self-attention mechanisms to patches of images. This allows for global context capture that CNNs often struggle with.

## Audio Processing and Beyond
From speech-to-text to music generation, transformers are proving to be the universal architecture for sequential data.
